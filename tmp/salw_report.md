### Sudan: Video claims to show RSF firing mortars at military base west of Omdurman

On March 29 the Sudan War Monitor (SWM) reposted a video observed circulating on social media which it said showed "an [anti-government Rapid Support Forces] RSF mortar crew in Ombada, west of Omdurman, targeting the Markhiyat Hills, [on] March 28. and "likely targeting Al-Markhiyat [military] camp [west of Omdurman] located about 7.5 km from the site."  “Although the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) announced that they seized control of Omdurman, the video highlights the extent of the RSF deployment near the areas controlled by SAF in Omdurman,” SWM said.

The video showed a presumed RSF fighter in military camouflage preparing and firing a possible 81mm/82mm mortar three times at an unseen target, near a road with a building under construction in the background and a completed building further away.  

At least eight other fighters are seen nearby assisting in the operation, bringing mortar rounds to the firing team from at least six boxes. A closed box and a number of cylinders, presumably cases for the mortar rounds are seen on the ground. In the video, a voice off-camera says: "Today is March 28 inside Al-Markhiyat."

The Sudan War Monitor and the @OSINTSudan X account geolocated the location of the fighters to Ombada area, west of Omdurman.

SWM said it had obtained the video from @mujahed_altayeb, which appears to be pro-RSF X account (see: https://twitter.com/mujahed_altayeb/status/1773499121644470559).

[Two other videos said to be from Markhiyat were observed circulating on pro-RSF social media on March 28. The first one claimed to show RSF fighters in front of the Markhiyat hills [military zone] who had "defeated [Sudanese Armed Forces commander] Burhan’s militia." URL:

The second claimed to show a group of armed RSF fighters displaying "spoils" captured from government forces in Markhiyat. The items included what appeared to be a PK-type light machine gun and at least four AK-pattern rifles. URL:

### Uganda: Soldier pleads guilty to loss of live ammunition during DR Congo tour of duty

A military court in Kampala convicted a soldier who lost 30 rounds of live ammunition while on a tour of duty in neighboring DR Congo, the New Vision website reported on February 28.

Private Edward Ssali, a member of the Uganda Peoples' Defense Forces (UPDF) 9 Infantry Battalion, pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to protect war materials assigned to him. The court heard that Ssali lost 30 "submachine" [likely AK rifle] rounds while at Mabenga Trading Center in DR Congo's Rutshuru Territory on or around July 31, 2023. Ssali's commanding officer ordered a search of the center for the lost magazine, but with no result, one witness said.

The court adjourned the hearing until March 5 to allow for mitigating arguments, the report said.
